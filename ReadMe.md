# Alloy Optimisation Coding Challenge

This solution contains the implemation of a Coding challenge to produce a model for a metallic alloy with the purpose to generate one with an optimum composition.
It was developed using .Net 10.0, in VS Code.
GenAI was used as a research tool, primarily around modern .Net tooling and challenging design decisions (to ensure the decisions were "the best", a bit like the rubbber duck approach).
All code was updated to the developer's taste.

## Installation

In order to run the various examples, please follow these steps:
* Install [.Net 10.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
* Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
* Open the directory this ReadMe is in with VS Code

## Running the examples

All code can be compiled with command (from a terminal set to the location of this ReadMe):
```
dotnet build
```

Similarly, to run all unit tests, run:
```
dotnet test
```
